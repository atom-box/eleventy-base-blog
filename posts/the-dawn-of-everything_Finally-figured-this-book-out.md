The Dawn of Everything is an exciting cross. It is a comprehensive history survey combined with a call to action: Jared Diamond but then also Naomo Klein. This

First, the authors have produced a collapsed, illustrationless textbook. Imagine a textbook for a history/anthropology survey course called Civilization 210. They cover the Jared Diamond type question: what are the ways humans devised for making societies? It spends 30% of the time in Neolithic and Bronze Age and 70% of the time in every (every!) non western society you can think of.  The thing that makes it a collapsed textbook, is mostly illustrationless.  What you are left with is 526 pages, written at a popular level. If you added some graphics, some headings, some end of the chapter questions, you would have a textbook.
