Job searching as a web developer with two years of professional experience has been patchy sometimes. Most companies don't seem to recruit totally green devs and say "here's the keys, you drive for awhile". Here are some things that I have figured out the hard way mostly. 

## Some job titles allow 0 - 2 years experience

A lot of folks overlook jobs that have *customer* or even *sales* in the role title. Those jobs are sometimes extremely technical and satisfying for a more extraverted engineer.

For me, specifically, I have found that rather than full time web development, I like customer interaction while solving web development problems and I like multiple small engineering projects rather than a long slow build of a single huge site. Once I realized what this job is called I saw there are many customer facing roles that are looking for people with junior level web development experience.  For me, all of these jobs gave me callbacks and a lot of them require varying amounts of web skills .
- customer success
- sales engineer 
- sales support
- customer advocate
- customer support
- technical support
- production support
- desktop support
- support technician

These are all client facing. Make sure you like that because have to be relatively extroverted in these roles. This is a whole legit career ladder you can climb at a larger company.  Customer support has juniors and seniors just like full time web development. And you can move on up into managing, training, and recruiting the other tech support folks if the company is large enough.   

Start finding these by searching one of the job titles above along with a tech term, like *javascript* or *gatsby* or *cypress testing*.  Not all job websites can filter like that.  I found LinkedIn was pretty good for this kind of filtering.

## Positions for Full Stack Developer

This is never a junior position.  When someone says Full Stack, they mean at the very least someone who has professionally, at a paid position, worked on web development for 4+ years, including working in a team and merging different people's work.  

## How many jobs are even advertised

I heard that only 30% of the web developer openings ever get written up into an ad for a site like Linked In. That was mentioned by Gergely Orosz, an Uber engineer who wrote The Tech Resume: Inside Out.  

## Try searching without going to a jobs site

Click the careers link at the bottom of the tech you use.  You already go to the pages for Node, Next, Github, Postman, Wordpress to read the documentation.  All of those sites have a *careers* link at the bottom of their footer.  All of those places hire developers.  

Every 3rd party you can think of also hires too.  Bloomreach, TaxJar, BrightPattern, FontAwesome, Button, Stripe, Shopify, Listrak all have a *careers* link for their open paid positions.

Companies that are receiving venture capital are often growing and hiring. Try looking up startup lists at [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/funding-rounds-this-week/597d61b8-3ffe-426c-903e-6e33bcb29f9d/funding_rounds). Or discover companies that are the leaders in their sector by browsing the many lists at the bottom of [Owler](https://corp.owler.com/)

## Do you love Rust?

If there is a certain technology you love (Go, Rust, Self driving cars), find nice sounding roles that are too beyond you now ("Senior Dev Needed, 8 yrs experience") and research that specific company to find their entry level openings. If you get in, you have positioned yourself for the next step on the ladder and have a leg up as an internal hire.  Example: The senior dev jobs posted at Drupal.org are beyond me, but I can 


## Testing jobs

Learning to write reasonable tests can be picked up in a couple months, and it is a good alternative foot in the door if you prefer a role where you just see your team and a machine and no clients. Look for these job titles:

- QA Engineer*
- Testing Engineer*

Make sure you know the specific terms and skills, such as "P.O.I.S.E.D." Install and watch a tutorials about Postman, Insomnia, Cypress, Selenium, PHPUnit, Mocha, Cucumber, et al.
