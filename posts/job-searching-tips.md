Job searching as a web developer with two years of professional experience has been patchy sometimes. Here are some things that I have figured out the hard way mostly.

## The Job Title "Web Developer"

If you search the ads for the job title "Web Developer", the job requirements don't usually ask for <3 years experience.  What I discovered is, there are LOTS of openings for people with 0 - 3 years of web developer experience. They justs aren't called that title. They are called *Customer Success, Customer Support, Support Engineer*, or similar.  Most companyies aren't desperate enough to recruit totally green devs and say "here's the keys, you drive for awhile". 

## Full Stack Developer

This is doubly true of "Full Stack Developer".  When someone says Full Stack, they mean at the very least someone who has built, for money, a full stack and deployed it to production, or more likely, has been in the business for 4+ years. 

## There's gold at the bottom of the page

Click the careers link at the bottom of the tech you use.  Node, Next, Github, Postman, Wordpress... all of these places hire developers.  

## Do you love Rust?

If there is a certain technology you love (Go, Rust, Self driving cars), find nice sounding roles that are too beyond you now ("Senior Dev Needed, 8 yrs experience") and research that specific company to find their entry level openings. If you get in, you have positioned yourself for the next step on the ladder and have a leg up as an internal hire.  Example: The senior dev jobs posted at Drupal.org are beyond me, but I can 

## Some job titles that allow for 0 - 2 years experience

- customer success
- sales engineer 
- sales support
- customer advocate
- customer support
- technical support
- production support
- desktop support
- support technician

These are all client facing. Make sure you like that.

## Testing jobs

Learning to write reasonable tests can be picked up in a couple months, and it is a good alternative foot in the door if you prefer a role where you just see your team and a machine and no clients. Look for these job titles:

- QA Engineer*
- Testing Engineer*

Make sure you know the specific terms and skills, such as "P.O.I.S.E.D." Install and watch a tutorials about Postman, Insomnia, Cypress, Selenium, PHPUnit, Mocha, Cucumber, et al. There's a funny, wise, wide-ranging conversation about testing with Andre Young on Episode 143 of [Web Rush](https://johnpapa.net/old-man-yells-at-tests-with-andre-young-on-web-rush-143/).
