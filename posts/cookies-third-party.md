## Hubspot Notes
[The Death of the Third-Party Cookie: What Marketers Need to Know About Google's 2022 Phase-Out](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/third-party-cookie-phase-out)
* Chrome Browser popularity peaked five years ago.  But it is still 2/3 of the desktop browser market .  2/3 Chrome, including mobile. 1/10 Safari
* Consider fingerprints as the post 3rd party cookie?
* Safari and Firefox have blocked 3rd party cookies for a long time
* If you're just aiming to track your website's visitors' behaviors, preferences, and basic demographics only while they're on your website, you probably won't be deeply impacted by this change.
* First party cookies are all the things they did on your site. Importantly this includes their return and prior visits
* First party cookie examples: remembering passwords, basic data about the visitor, and other preferences.
* Third party is: what are they doing elsewhere
* Third party is: a retargeting list that can be used to send ads to your past visitors or people with similar web profiles.
