## Definitions used in this podcast

GRR
NRR  
Kopp talks a lot about NRR in this episode. The best definition I found was from https://www.businessinsider.jp/post-215709 :  
  
*Net Revenue Retention, sometimes called Net Dollar Retention, is an indicator of "whether sales from customers once acquired will increase or decrease in the future.*
