## Email checklist  
Glance through the email you just finished.  Look for these things:  
1. __Thanks!__ For using our product, for showing what needs fixing, for taking the time to not grumble, ghost, et cetera...
2. What did you skip? They need at least a nod for **every thing** they raised.  Go back and re-read their original email.  
3. There is underlying emotion. Did you address their __emotional__ subtext? So at least mention their emotion.
4. Be correct: it's hard to look like a problem solver if you are sending things that are wrong. Proofread. Try your suggestions first yourself.

## How to say No
These tips were at the Freshdesk blog.   

It's important to draw boundaries: customer cannot have unhaveable things. Nor should they negotiate away your control. You should retain control. Therefore, judiciously know how to say NO.  
  
If you need to say No, say it clearly and as soon as you realize you need to say it.  
  
Append it: *"No, and..."* emphasizing a next step or the next best thing.  You have to stay out of their line of fire.  

## Effortless is the new goal
This was in a book I got from the library.  

Customer service used to attempt to "give excellent service": service that makes customers remark "wow! that was surprisingly great service!".  

But in the last 10 years this has been given way to Effortless CX.  There's even a score, CES, which scores Customer Effort Score, for SaaS companies, 0 to 7, where 7 is best: an *effortless* customer experience.  Example of this: https://inmoment.com/blog/ces-new-ways-saas-companies-are-using-customer-effort-cx-metric/ 

## Personality type [research result]
Which personality traits predict someone will stay and thrive in a customer facing role?  

CEB and Matthew Dixon did a study: 440 customer service supervisors described three of specific employees they knew well, rating them as average performing, better than average, or worse than average.  They assessed 74 behaviors for each employee.  

They found 21 traits in four clusters:  

__IQ: Advanced Problem Solving__  
Curious  
Creative  
Capable of critical thinking  
Experimental  
  
__Basic Skills__  
Demonstrates product knowledge  
Demonstrates technological expertise  
Communicates confidently  
Communicates clearly  
Asks good questions  
Capable of multitasking  
  
__EQ: Emotional Intelligence__  
Empathic  
Able to flex tto different personality types  
Has customer service ethic  
Extroverted enough to be comfortable interacting with strangers  
Advocates for the consumer  
Persuasive  
  
__CQ: Control Quotient__  
Resilient  
Able to handle high-pressure situations without becoming burned out  
Takes responsibility for own actions  
Responds well to constructive criticism by managers  
Able to concentrate on tasks over extended periods of time  
  
The last cluster, CQ, is something that managers should enable. Doing that is supported by giving agents autonomy and release from time restrictions in their Key Performance Indicators.

This study is described in the book [The Effortless Experience: Conquering the New Battleground for Customer Loyalty](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/25119618-the-effortless-experience-conquering-the-new-battleground-for-customer)  
Matthew Dixon, Nick Toman, Rick Delisi, of CEB  2013.  

## Fish!
Teach customers to solve their own problem.  When appropriate.

## Privacy vs Personalization 
Through Google Analytics customers are tracked. In research, customers say they find this loss of privacy creepy. But *at the same time* they also increasingly expect personalized service.


## Metrics  
Possible stats to expect in a call center:  
* average handle time
* first contact resolution (FCR)
* SLA's 

## Don't confuse Customer Support with Customer Success

## Old School Techniques
I found these in an ancient pdf of WIC food stamp counselors. It was full of 1998 clip art but it had some things to consider  
* Instead of declaring things, give the customer choices, or get them to finish your sentences.  
* Listening may not be hearing: is there a tacit thing being asked? Ask for clarification.  
* Do the advanced work -- if your client list is small enough, pro-actively get on the good foot when possible

These are from the 1998 WIC document too!   
*We always admire the other fellow more
after we have tried to do his job.*  
  William Feather

*After the verb ‘to love’,          
‘to help’ is the most beautiful verb in the world.*
Bertha Von Sutter  

*A few kind words take only seconds to say,
but their echos can go on for years.*

*It is one of the most beautiful compensations of this life
that no man can sincerely try to help another       
without helping himself.*                     
Ralph Waldo Emerson

*Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you.  
Their tastes may not be the same.*
