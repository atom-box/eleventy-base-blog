Customers are rarely angry. But they are. Be prepared!  

## A A A
Self explanatory mnemonic:  
**A**cknowledge  
**A**llign  
**A**ssure  

The Kayako blog gives examples of these:
```
Acknowledge:

    “I noticed that you left a review on your interaction with me that mentioned that the solution I’d offered didn’t work for you, so I wanted to reach out and see if we could get it fixed.”

Align:

    “I know that you didn’t respond directly to my email and left a review instead. If you’ve decided that you don’t want to work through this any further, I totally understand. If that’s the case, please just ignore this email. Otherwise, could you let me know what steps didn’t work as expected?”

Assure:

    “Once I have a bit more information, I’m happy to help get everything resolved for you.”
```

You are in the customer's line of fire. If you can allign with them, in their eyes, you are by definition no longer in their line of fire. Metaphorically, your goal is to move from your side of the table around to their side of the table.  Like an executive coming out from behind their desk. Figure out how to "come out from behind your desk".

## Another mnemonic  
P – Power word (react to the customer’s emotion), “oh” or “oh my”.  
I – I statement (relating to the customer’s experience) showing a  human connection.  
A – Assurance that you’re going to resolve the customer’s issue.

## Allow anger

Turn on your empathy, try to imagine what preceded their anger: bad day, bad life, bad migraine...  Visualize that as your starting point.  

## De-escalation tricks from Zendesk  
If this is full flame-on, time to de-escalate.
* Switch channels: Twitter -> phone call, Email -> screenshare, et al
* Video call helps, gives clues in both directions. Turn on Zoom or similar.
* Leave the call, having given list of next steps and timetables. Then stick to that roadmap and timetable, giving them updates.

## They feel wronged
They feel wronged. (1) Convince them you are on their side (2) Give evidence that a way forward exists, tools exist.

You are in their line of fire; if you can get on their side, you won't be.


## Did they have prior touch points?
Are they coming from Tier 1? Get down to business quickly. If you are their first touch point, though, listen, let them vent, repeat back to them what you heard.
