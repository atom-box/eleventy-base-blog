Customers are rarely angry. But they are. Be prepared!  

## Why is this person angry?

It's directed at you but use your empathy to imagine what preceded it: bad day, bad life, bad migraine...  Visualize that as your starting point.  

## They feel wronged
They feel wronged. (1) Convince them you are on their side (2) Give evidence that a way forward exists, tools exist.

You are in their line of fire; if you can get on their side, you won't be.

## Did they have prior touch points?
Are they coming from Tier 1? Get down to business quickly. If you are their first touch point, though, listen, let them vent, repeat back to them what you heard. 

## De-escalation
If this is full flame-on, time to de-escalate.
* Switch channels: Twitter -> phone call, Email -> screenshare, et al
* Video call helps, gives clues in both directions. Turn on Zoom or similar.
* Leave them with a next steps. Then stick to that roadmap and timetable, giving them updates.
