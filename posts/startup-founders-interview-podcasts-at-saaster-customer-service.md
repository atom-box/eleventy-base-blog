SaaSter is a business heavy podcast.  As tech podcasts go it is barely tech.  It is about growing a company, fostering company culture, hiring salespeople, running customer support: this is solidly about "Business". The companies are all software companies, so, even if you are not a business expert, the conversations are interesting.  I can vouch for the episodes where they profiled these companies:

1. Postman
[Abhinav Asthana](https://www.saastr.com/building-a-5-6b-company-with-a-product-led-flywheel-with-postmans-ceo-abhinav-asthana-pod-528-video/) 
Postman is an exciting product to use.  The company is very large already. According to [Owler](https://www.owler.com/company/postman2):
Est. Annual Revenue
$25-100M
Est. Employees
250-500
Funding
$433M

I would give this episode 3/5 stars.  
I liked Abhinav's point about "repeated customer queries must feed back into the product itself".

2. Terminus
[Tim Kopp](https://www.saastr.com/the-playbook-to-boosting-net-retention-quickly-with-terminus/) 

Terminus is a shipping app.  If I remember this episode correctly, he explains how to hire explosively. I think Terminus went from 5 salesman to 95 salesman in the space of a year. He explains how they did it. 

I would give this episode 4/5 stars. The product is boring but the business aspect is good.  The speaker is a bit testosteroney but is an effective communicator and a reasonably skilled rhetoritician.  

Quoting Amelia Ibarra quoting Tim Kopp here, from this episode:

```
To maximize growth, you must dedicate your efforts to net retention. Retention is the new acquisition. To deploy the most effective strategy, Tim recommends the following tips:

    Use an ABM framework to target your high-value customer accounts.
    Engage your customers via a multi-channel strategy.
    Leverage Customer Success to get the data you need to run the right plays.
    Measure NDS/Satisfaction scores, usage rates, and expansion opportunities.

```
This is Saaster Podcast Episode 431, February 26, 2021

3. ProfitWell

[Patrick Campbell](https://www.saastr.com/saastr-podcast-429-with-profitwell-founder-ceo-patrick-campbell-the-current-state-of-saas-companies-subscriptions-and-retention-in-2021/)
I don't remember many details but I remember I liked this episode. He discussed the *salvage offers* tactic, when a customer fails to renew with your SaaS.

From the show's description:

```
In this episode, ProfitWell Founder & CEO Patrick Campbell shares benchmarks from over 23,000 companies and offers a helpful framework to re-evaluate your retention strategy and increase your CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) between 10 and 60%.
```
4/5 stars. Published on July 20, 2021
