I have ended up wanting to master a CMS. How did I get here? In 2020 I spent a year helping maintain and build a huge Symfony site with a team of 9 developers. After I left, I wanted to still have a gigantic site to do things with. How to do this by myself? Symfony can build a huge site like that. To make the Symfony site complete, and to do some things easily, and to make a site that other people might want to buy from me (e.g. as a freelancer) I need to wrap it in something friendly like a CMS. Drupal seems to be the way to go, for many, many reasons. So where to get good at Drupal?

## Best Courses for Learning Drupal

Disappointing series:
    * Drupalize.me.  Not worth the paywall, that's for sure.  It feels like a wrapper someone made around the official docs.

Good series:
    The Ryan Weaver Drupal videos at [Symfonycasts](https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/drupal8-under-the-hood). For developers writing OOP Symfony, emphasizing correct dependency injection for the classes of PHP. Output of the pages is all with Symfony Twig. There is no use of the Drupal GUI. This was my gateway tutorial that got me excited to go look up Drupal CMS in the first place.
    [Evolving Web]() Live instruction, peer to peer breakout rooms with classmates. Build your own track, starting in the fall and finishing in the spring. About CA$450 per week.
    [WebWash](https://www.webwash.net/getting-started-with-bootstrap-4-using-radix-in-drupal/) courses. By Ivana Zugec.  Dozens of great Drupal videos.
    [Talking Drupal](https://talkingdrupal.com/).  This is a weekly podcast but it is as good as taking a course. The hosts banter about their personal lives at the start of each course but, skipping that, the podcast is essentially 300+ lessons in Drupal with APIs, JSON, deployment.  Occasional long interviews too, with the creator of Drupal, Dries Buytaert.
    Forty short videos from [Acquia](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpVC00PAQQxHi-llE9Z8-Q747NYWpsq6t).
    [Level Up](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/drupal-8-basics/our-first-blog-post) course, by Scott Tolinski
    The actual [docs](https://www.drupal.org/). They are emergent, sprawling, well-written, but very much "open source". The official documentation is a series of loosely linked pages written over many years, and pulled into the vast archipelago at Drupal.org

## My Sites

I'm trying some of these things out at [drupal.farm](https://drupal.farm/)

## One year plan

I want to move on to more powerful Drupal set ups by the end of the year.
