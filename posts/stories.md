# Tell us about yourself

I have a blankout when a stranger asks me this, especially on a remote Zoom Call where I'm also being asked to whiteboard Fizz Buzz. A lot of stuff that happens, I forget it when asked about it later. I am jotting some *happenings* here therefore so in the future I may have fewer *wonderings*.

## Story about a victory

Date: 10-03-2021  

Returning to Symfony, spinning up this http://clue.school project I made.  

### Story of proud coding: having a mental model of my remote server 

Starting in June, 2021 I'm super facile with __deploying__.  I impulsively bought three URLs, made an A record at the rackspace, made the DNS forwarding at the Domain Server, SSH'ing in and made a new server block in my Apache at the rack.  Did that all in less than an hour. Without looking ANYTHING up. Feels almost crazy that I could do that. End result: a URL that had never existed in the history of the world now exists and it says *hello*.


### Story 1 about hard work

### Story 2 about hard work  
I haven't conceptualized Working hard <----> Not working hard. I think ALL THE TIME about ticking off my to do list.  (Same as anyone in any job with any autonomy...)  My tools are different-time-of-day awareness: work great 6am to 10am and second burst from 3pm until 8pm.  And externalizing the task switcher: to a timer.  I recently stopped doing this with a spiral pad held down with a pomodoro paper weight. It's less organic/charming but Gnu Calendar is clean, great example of Gnu's design-sense and UI.  

Steven Covey's Seven Habits and Howard Gardener's lists (Getting Things Done) are ingrained in my strategies, for years now.

My lists and prioritizing system are iPhone lists and my bloggish things, incl Twitter and this blog here.  

Yes, focusing, not finishing the project, like https://clue.school...

After leaving my back end job in April 2021 I knew I needed a few weeks (months really but was impatient) of specific, added skills before I could apply succesfully for positions.  I circled my car around a parking lot: I did 3 week chunks of: __Symfony__ exercises/videos (shout-out to Ryan Weaver and Symfonycasts), __Drupal__ (many sources, shout out to some of the Template designers, to Evolving Web of Montreal, to OS Learning Drupal videos, to Web Wash), building out my sites at [Pikl](https://pikl.us/), [Drupal Farm](https://drupal.farm/), and [Clue School](https://www.clue.school/)

### A tech problem I solved: good looking CSS   

A sign of my maturitty in web development: I switched from pridefully doing the CSS line by line to just grabbing resources.  
  
I was too prideful before to do this but also I didn't know resources. I went through a Bootstrap phase but am now down to things a fraction of that library in size: w3schools CSS and even smaller, the ______ (CSS library with South Asian name...).
  
[Clue School](https://www.clue.school/) came out looking good, for example.  For that I used a Template from W3Schools.

Started building Static Node.js web server: Eleventy too.  

 
### Errors and error messages

And just as good as those two things: little bugs in serving a first landing page from Twig are no big deal.  The error messages are not really enough to be docs.  You gotta already know the rough outline of which actors should be present.  All those months at DOI I would have to unspool the errors a line at a time with no knowledge of what was there.  YOu can't really backwards trace the breadcrumbs like that.  So...


I knew the db was missing, I knew how to pluck the right line from the SQLIte, MYSql, the defaulted PostGres, et al.  And then with no hints in that code, know enough to go put it in .env.local, not where it was uncommented from.  And know what to .gitignore and what not to.   

And the three branches to proceed down.  And how to know which methods are arriving in the IDE.   

The route worked in dev and then not in production.  https://clue.school/notes  I easily could picture the route serving of Symfony can't happen correctly with Apache heading things off at the pass.  Knew how to search site:symfony.com   And upon finding the stuff was not tempted to write it down "phonetically" as I even would have in May.
