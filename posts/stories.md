I don't want to draw a blank when interviewers ask me to talk about myself.  This page can be a place to talk about myself ahead of time.  

## Talk about what you have been up to   
Summer 2021 has been trying to find a parking spot. I have this LAMP stack foundation. I spent the year tentatively trying on different versions of that: make full websites? (Drupal) Stay back end? (https://pikl.us project) Go all database? (1010Data). Finally realized Customer Support solves my Mom's complaint: "You are naturally good at a lot of things and I see you as just chasing all of these new things you never did before; leverage your natural gifts!". And so: Customer Support.

## What do you like to do
Echos of Mt Whitney:  keep up my recreational 1 hour walk to coding -- that's my version of all that bike riding Dad always insisted on. Go poke around at code is my entertainment. That's my crossword puzzle. 

## What do you find difficult
I like toying with code.  

Unfortunately that will never build some big focused result. You can enjoy swinging a hammer but that is not the same is putting up a house. 

My level of coding ability hopefully meshes really well with Customer Service in a role that touches something similar to a LAMP stack, from the SQL db all the way through to the front end and even deploying.  

But probably not at the network level: too far afield. That opening at Cloudflare would be like starting all over again.  Same with 1010Data.com.  

## Story about a victory

Returning to Symfony, spinning up this http://clue.school project I made.  

## Tell a victory

Building Symfony OOP things of my own this summer, everything clicked.  I realized I'm not dumb.  

When my URL Shortener (LAMP stack at https://pikl.us) gave errors I knew the db was missing, I knew how to pluck the right line from the SQLIte, MYSql, the defaulted PostGres, et al.  And then with no hints in that code, know enough to go put it in .env.local, not where it was uncommented from.  And know what to .gitignore and what not to.   

And the three branches to proceed down.  And how to know which methods are arriving in the IDE.   

The route worked in dev and then not in production.  https://clue.school/notes  I easily could picture the route serving of Symfony can't happen correctly with Apache heading things off at the pass.  Knew how to search site:symfony.com   And upon finding the stuff was not tempted to write it down "phonetically" as I even would have in May.  

### Story of proud coding: having a mental model of my remote server 

Starting in June, 2021 I'm super facile with __deploying__.  I impulsively bought three URLs, made an A record at the rackspace, made the DNS forwarding at the Domain Server, SSH'ing in and made a new server block in my Apache at the rack.  Did that all in less than an hour. Without looking ANYTHING up. Feels almost crazy that I could do that. End result: a URL that had never existed in the history of the world now exists and it says *hello*.


### Story 1 about hard work  
I have had a pretty constant coding habit.  The gaps in my repository commits came at three times this year when I was learning things that had little to do with commiting files:
1. Symfonycasts tutorials in May 2021  
2. Drupal tutorials in August 2021  
3.  Google Analytics, Tealium, and Matomo tag manager in October 2021

### Story 2 about hard work  
I haven't conceptualized Working hard <----> Not working hard. I think ALL THE TIME about ticking off my to do list.  (Same as anyone in any job with any autonomy...)  My tools are different-time-of-day awareness: work great 6am to 10am and second burst from 3pm until 8pm.  And externalizing the task switcher: to a timer.  I recently stopped doing this with a spiral pad held down with a pomodoro paper weight. It's less organic/charming but Gnu Calendar is clean, great example of Gnu's design-sense and UI.  

Steven Covey's Seven Habits and Howard Gardener's lists (Getting Things Done) are ingrained in my strategies, for years now.

My lists and prioritizing system are iPhone lists and my bloggish things, incl Twitter and this blog here.  

Yes, focusing, not finishing the project, like https://clue.school...

After leaving my back end job in April 2021 I knew I needed a few weeks (months really but was impatient) of specific, added skills before I could apply succesfully for positions.  I circled my car around a parking lot: I did 3 week chunks of: __Symfony__ exercises/videos (shout-out to Ryan Weaver and Symfonycasts), __Drupal__ (many sources, shout out to some of the Template designers, to Evolving Web of Montreal, to OS Learning Drupal videos, to Web Wash), building out my sites at [Pikl](https://pikl.us/), [Drupal Farm](https://drupal.farm/), and [Clue School](https://www.clue.school/)

## Why did you leave your last job  
After a year and 3 months at OfficeSupply.com I got replaced by a developer with more experience: 5+ years versus my 0 years.  

Here is a spider graph of my work there, doing Code Reviews and making Pull Requests in their repo at Github:

### A tech problem I solved: good looking CSS   

A sign of my maturitty in web development: I switched from pridefully doing the CSS line by line to just grabbing resources.  
  
I was too prideful before to do this but also I didn't know resources. I went through a Bootstrap phase but am now down to things a fraction of that library in size: w3schools CSS and even smaller, the ______ (CSS library with South Asian name...).
  
[Clue School](https://www.clue.school/) came out looking good, for example.  For that I used a Template from W3Schools.

Started building Static Node.js web server: Eleventy too.  

## Learn how to write biz speak: 
This is how recruiters talk:   

*"Evan Genest has 3 years of experience in the industry. He is local to Madison, Wisconsin, and is very interested in hearing more about this opportunity with Foo Bar Baz."*

*"Evan is passionate about software support, in his role as a Customer Success Agent for Scooter Software, he was providing troubleshooting and support on their software, hardware, and infrastructure.  He conducted technical demos for clients, created technical documentation for power users, and has hands-on experience with database and server logs.  He's great with software, has a lot of experience working in SQL, performing manual testing, and ensuring customer satisfaction as often as he can."*

And then he skipped anything else, including my much harder job I went to after that. Keep it short, focused. Nobody wants to read more than five sentences. About anything.  

## Evan is passionate about software support  
Not crazy about the recruiter saying I am *passionate* about software support. Ardent or conscientious maybe are okay, but I am not "passionate" about business correspondance.  

Intense and driven maybe? That is just from the point of view of crossing tasks off of a todo list on my plate.  

## Where are you at? What do you want?   
I want to be somewhere and be good at it. I want to get that good feeling from gaining expertise, like when I first started coding.
  
My identity goal might be: he's smart at something + at work, his phone never stops ringing. And provide for my family in a field with good pay that is not going away between now and 2040. And looking at narrow coding things that are over and done in 30 to 90 minutes.

Reading more Seth Godin books could help me pick up language that biz people but still sound honest. 

### Tell me a time you had a problem.  (Or also) How do you troubleshoot?

The error messages are not really enough to be docs.  You gotta already know the rough outline of which actors should be present.  All those months at DOI I would have to unspool the errors a line at a time with no knowledge of what was there.  You can't really backwards trace the breadcrumbs like that.  I solved that by coming to the foundation under the hood, by degrees.  There's no substitute for that.  

On the other end of the pole, Amy is right to know when to just Google something and move on.   

I admire Ryan because he is a blend of those two things: knows when to dig for what's happening vs when to just put in a working line.  I guess that is the coder's version of Wisdom.

## Example of working late, extra to ship something.
## Training you took that had a specific benefit to your company  
## How do you troubleshoot?
Some generalized places to look.  
1. If you're in a browser, 
- clear the cache. Try a different browser. 
- In devtools->network, see what is loading, maybe compare it to a similar site. Or to your site before you made the breaking change.
- adblocker and antivirus causing issues in the browser?
2. Dependencies:
- your db is present? being accessed correctly? check this in its log?
- your language (PHP?) is appropriate version? has specific modules (tokenizer.ini?) installed?
3. Can you just reinstall something? Maybe with a different version or different options?
4. Troubleshoot the configuration of your application. Compare your config to a backup or default config. Maybe use Beyond Compare to do this.
5. Network: is there a proxy in the way? Redirecting? Apache and nginx and their config?
6. Check the logs. Replicate the bug and check the logs some more.  In the command line, you can autorefresh the tail of the log `tail --follow example.txt`
7. Copy error messages from the log. Search. Copy error messages from the terminal. Search.

I brainstormed this list while reading a great specific site that applies these principles, the [FAQ page](https://matomo.org/faq) at Matomo.org.  

## How do you help a client go holistic on a project?  
User Experience designers do it like this:  

1. Questionaires.  Get out of your own head. The closer you get to what your real users are like the more they will enjoy what you build.
2. Develop fictional personas.
    - a random person who arrived by organic search
    - a current employee
    - a volunteer to your org
    - a job seeker
    - a potential customer
3. Map ideal journeys those personas would take on your site. What you're paid to do is align what the user feels is a happy experience and what your organization considers a happy experience. Notice we have not written any code yet.
4. Inventory the existing and potential content.
    - if a competitor site or your org's existing site are relevant you can inventory those. An automatic free tool for building a data tree of site content is at [Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/#spider-features)
5. Architect your site. Design the relational database. Make wireframes.
6. Concept! Let the designers mock up some pages.
7. Develop. Realize the site in code.
8. Continuous Improvement.
