## Effortless is the new goal

Customer service used to attempt to "give excellent service": service that makes customers remark "wow! that was surprisingly great service!". But in the last 10 years this has been given way to Effortless CX.  There's even a score, CES, which scores Customer Effort Score, for SaaS companies, 0 to 7, where 7 is best: an *effortless* customer experience.  Example of this: https://inmoment.com/blog/ces-new-ways-saas-companies-are-using-customer-effort-cx-metric/ 

## Characteristics of people who succeed in Customer facing roles

CEB and Matthew Dixon did a study: 440 customer service supervisors described three of specific employees they knew well, rating them as average performing, better than average, or worse than average.  They assessed 74 behaviors for each employee.  The result gave a list of best behaviors:
