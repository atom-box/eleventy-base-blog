## Effortless is the new goal

Customer service used to attempt to "give excellent service": service that makes customers remark "wow! that was surprisingly great service!". 

But in the last 10 years this has been given way to Effortless CX.  There's even a score, CES, which scores Customer Effort Score, for SaaS companies, 0 to 7, where 7 is best: an *effortless* customer experience.  Example of this: https://inmoment.com/blog/ces-new-ways-saas-companies-are-using-customer-effort-cx-metric/ 

## Personality type

Do you have what it takes? Which personality traits help someone stay and thrive in a customer facing role? 

CEB and Matthew Dixon did a study: 440 customer service supervisors described three of specific employees they knew well, rating them as average performing, better than average, or worse than average.  They assessed 74 behaviors for each employee.  

They found 21 traits in four clusters:  

__IQ: Advanced Problem Solving__  
Curious  
Creative  
Capable of critical thinking  
Experimental  
  
__Basic Skills__  
Demonstrates product knowledge  
Demonstrates technological expertise  
Communicates confidently  
Communicates clearly  
Asks good questions  
Capable of multitasking  
  
__EQ: Emotional Intelligence__  
Empathic  
Able to flex tto different personality types  
Has customer service ethic  
Extroverted enough to be comfortable interacting with strangers  
Advocates for the consumer  
Persuasive  
  
__CQ: Control Quotient__  
Resilient  
Able to handle high-pressure situations without becoming burned out  
Takes responsibility for own actions  
Responds well to constructive criticism by managers  
Able to concentrate on tasks over extended periods of time  
  
The last cluster, CQ, is something that managers should enable. Doing that is supported by giving agents autonomy and release from time restrictions in their Key Performance Indicators.

This study is described in the book [The Effortless Experience: Conquering the New Battleground for Customer Loyalty](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/25119618-the-effortless-experience-conquering-the-new-battleground-for-customer)

## Old School Techniques

* In your response, give the customer choices.  
* Remind, repeatedly, that you will help, that you have the resources to do so. 
* Listening may not be hearing: is there a tacit thing being asked? Ask for clarification.  
* Do the advanced work, pro-actively get on the good foot when possible

*Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you.  
Their tastes may not be the same.*
